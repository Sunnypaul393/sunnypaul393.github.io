						        <p>1303  In and around the Surma and the Kushiara, a patchwork of territories had emerged when Shah Jalal conquered local rajas and established Islam in Sylhet, creating a new Muslim cultural boundary.</p>

								<p>1346 When the traveller Ibn Batuta met Shah Jalal, the Sylhet landscape held diverse territories of Khasis, Garos, Hindus, Muslims and others.</p>

								<p>1627  The first recorded contact of the Assamese with the Catholic missionaries, when the Tibet-bound Jesuit missionaries, Stephen Cacella and John Cabral visited Goalpara and Kamrup districts on their way to Tibet.</p>       

								<p>1707  In 1707, the Khasis and the Jaintias jointly thwarted Ahom King Rudra Singh's invasion of Jaintiapur.</p>

								<p>1757  When the East India Company took Bengal from the Nawabs, the old northeastern frontiers of Mugal Bengal posed may problems. Khasis held most land north of the Surma and ruled mountains above. Jaintia Khasi rajas held mountains and lowlands north and east of Sylhet town.</p>

						        <p>1765  The East India Company acquires the district of Sylhet, as a result of the grant of the Diwani of Bengal (along with Bihar and Orissa) and the first contact is made between the British and the inhabitants of the Khasi Hills. The Khasis were located north of Sylhet district, and the Jaintias were to the north-east. At that time about half of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills district, including the country around the capital, Shillong, was outside the limits of British India, consisting of a collection of small states in political relations, regulated by treaty with the Government of India, which enjoyed almost complete autonomy in the management of their local affairs.</p>

								<p>The inhabitants of K&ign;J Hills first became known to the civilised world, when the East India Company established its stations in Bengal. At that time the Khasis not only inhabited the Hills, but also some portions of the Plains of Assam proper to the north, and Sylhet to the south. The town of Sylhet and the villages of Pandua and Chhatak were once in their possession. It was probably about this time that the Khasis obtained possession of those tracts of land in the Plains which they still continue to cultivate.</p>

								<p>At this time the Khasis used to come to pandua an the border of Sylhet to trade in silk, cotton goods, iron, wax, honey and ivory in exchange for rice, salt and dried fish[2]. Limestone from the Khasi Hills used to fulfill the demand in Bengal then. Soon British officials of the East India Company began trading in limestone and thus came in contact with the Khasis.</p>

						        <p>1774  A punitive expedition was conducted into the Jaintia Hills under the command of Major Henniker. It is probable that aggressions against the inhabitants of the Plains had rendered punishment necessary.</p>

								<p>1778  The officials of the East India Company were aware of the export business of limestone which was done from the Khasi Hills in the year 1778.</p>

						
								<p>1783 Khasi mountain warriors seized Pandua and the passes around. Sporadic warfare continued for 7 years between East India Company armies and Khasi rajas around Pandua.</p>

								<p>The Khasis attacked Pandua to avenge an insult offered to one of them by the Havildar of Robert Lindsay. The servant of Lindsay was killed and his lime kilns were destroyed. The prisoners taken were killed and scalped.

								<p>1784 Massive floods disrupted life drastically in the plains and mountains and famines ensued. This made the jungles between Pandua and Sunamganj more attractive to lowland farmers and investors.</p>

								<p>1786  David Scott was born on the 14 May 1786 (August according to memoir) in the North-East part of Scotland.</p>

								<p>1788  Conflict began in lowland forest villages north of Sunamganj, during flood induced famines. </p> 
</p>
								<p>1789  Early that year, two lowland Bengali Khasi warrior rajas, Ganga Singh and Aboo Singh, captured numerous villages and controlled several river routes. In the summer rebel Khasis and Bengali Khasis controlled 137 Bengali villages, Ganga Singh escaped to the hills, and Aboo Singh attached the Pandua fort, killing its commander.</p>

								<p>Marquis of Cornwallis, issued Orders for the definition of the boundary line and the collector was directed to inform the Khasis that they would not be permitted to come down armed, within the line of the Company’s frontier.</p>

								<p>1813   Charter Renewal: free trade and admission of missionaries.
								On 7 April, the first convert of Serampore Mission, Krishna Chandra Pal, proceed to Pandua (a trading post at the foot of the Khasi Hills immediately below Cherrapunjee) from Sylhet. Pandua was an important market and a meeting place of Khasis and Bengalis. Though it lies in the Plains, it still belonged to the Khasi kingdom of Cherrapunjee (Sohra). Entry to the Khasi Hills was primarily from the Sylhet plains through the Dwars – trading gateways – alongside rivers exiting into the plains from the hills and one travelled to Calcutta through East Bengal. A short while later, 7 people were baptised (including 2 Khasis) by Krishna by the banks of the Dlebolisshore river, in the presence of 8 native chiefs and 600 Khasis. On Pal’s return to Serampore, William Carey felt encouraged to begin translation of the Bible into Khasi language using Bengali script. Pal never returned to the Khasis.</p>

								<p>The favourable reports given by Krishna and others respecting the Khasis, moved Dr. William Carey to provide a translation of the New Testament in their language. The work was commenced in 1813, and an edition of 500 copies, printed in Bengali characters, was published in 1824.</p>

								<p>An effort was made early in 1815 to revive the work of Krishna Pal,  and a Portuguese brother, John De Silva was sent to Sylhet, together with a young Brahmin convert, Bhagvat, a native of Serampore. De Silva was chiefly employed instructing a number of destitute Portuguese who resided at Sylhet.</p>

								<p>1816  One of the English gentleman at Sylhet responded to William Carey expressing regret that he could then give no information “respecting the wild and savage race on the mountains, for at present it is very dangerous to go to these Hills. Two of these mountain Khasis were hanged at Sylhet a few days since, and another is condemned to remain in gaol for life, for murdering the Company’s subjects.”
</p>
								<p>1816  The Baptist Missionary Society of England had established the Serampore Mission which operated independently from the year 1816.
</p>
								<p>1817  An incident occurred over the lease of limestone quarries by the Syiem of Langrin to Inglis and Company, at an area called Lour (between Bogles Churrah on the west and Punatit on the east) for a term of 10 years.
</p>
								<p>1818  The Serampore mission work in Sylhet was abandoned.</p>

								<p>1821 The tea plant was first discovered growing in the wild in Upper Assam.</p>

         						<p>An attempt was made by a part of raiders from Jaintia to carry off a number of British subjects from Sylhet, to be offered as human sacrifices. The matter was brought to the notice of the Government, and the Rajah warned that any similar attempt would be punished with the forfeiture of his territory.</p>

        						<p>A dispute occurred when the Syiem of Nongstoin questioned the authority of the Syiem of Langrin over the quarries and in the process came into conflict with Inglis and Company. In September, the Khasi traders raided the area and carried off 7 of the Company’s men. The Nongstoin Syiem afterwards granted the lease to a French businessman.</p>

								<p>1822 In November, David Scott (known as Iskat Sahep to the Khasis) was appointed Agent to the Governor General for North East Frontier.</p>

								<p>In 1822, David Scott was made Civil Commissioner of the North-East parts of Rangpur.</p>

						        <p>1824  After the Burmese invasion of Assam, the British began their campaign against the Burmese. The outbreak of the first Burma War brought the British into closer relations with the Raja of Jaintia, and in April of that year Mr. David Scott, the Governor-General's Agent on the frontier, marched through his territory from Sylhet to Assam, emerging at Raha on the Kalang river, in what is now the Nowgong district. This was the first occasion on which Europeans had entered the hill territory of the Khasi tribes. After the First Burmese War, the Ava kingdom ceded the provinces of Manipur, Tenassarim, and Arakan to the British. Lower Assam (originally Koch Hajo) was formally annexed.</p>

								<p>On 10 March, 1824 two years before the Treaty of Yandaboo was signed, a treaty was concluded between David Scott, Agent to the Governor General on the part of the East India Company and "Ram Singh of Jaintia". By this Treaty, Ram Singh acknowledged allegiance to the Company and placed his country under the protection of the English.</p>

								<p>After the Treaty was signed, David Scott marched through the Jaintia territory with an escort of three Companies of the 23rd Regiment Native Infantry under Captain Horsburge. This was the second occasion on which Europeans had entered the hill territory of the Khasi tribes.</p>

								<p>Ever since this year, the relation between the English and the Khasi states was regulated by treaties, engagements and negotiations.</p>

								<p>44th Bengal Native Infantry (Goorkha Light Infantry – late 44th Sylhet Light Infantry. Raised 19 February 1824) – Linked  with 42nd and 43th Regiments[8]. Head Quarters at Manipore, Depot at Shillong. Uniform, Dark Green, Facings, Black.</p>

								<p>Dr. William Carey was moved to provide a translation of the New Testament in their language. The work was commenced in 1813, and an edition of 500 copies, printed in Bengali characters, was published in 1824.</p>

								<p>1825   An agreement was entered into with the Raja of Jaintia, Ram Sing, by which he promised to aid the British forces, should the Burmese attempt to enter the Assam valley by way of his territory. None of the conditions of the treaty were fulfilled. The British defeated the Burmese in upper Assam leading to the Treaty of Yandaboo.</p>

								<p>1826  Early in the year, at the conclusion of the Burmese war, a treaty was made by which Assam proper, was ceded to the British. Assam was included as a part of the Bengal Presidency. The Khasi Hills now, therefore, lay between two British possessions – the Assam valley in the north, and the Plains of Sylhet in the south. After the expulsion of the Burmese from Assam and the occupation of that province by the Company, Mr. David Scott (the Governor General’s Agent and Commissioner of Assam since 1826) entered the Khasi Hills (with Major White to Nongkhlaw on 1 November 1826) in order to negotiate for the construction of a road through the territory of the Khasi Siem or Chief of Nongkhlaw (U Teerut Singh), which aimed to link Sylhet with Gauhati.</p>

								<p>On 3 November 1826, an Agreement was signed between David Scott, Agent to the Governor General,  and Tirot Singh, Syiem of Nongkhlaw. By this Agreement, Nongkhlaw voluntarily agreed to become subject to the Company and under the protection of the English. Secondly, the Syiem agreed to give a free passage for troops through his country to go and come between Assam and Sylhet. Thirdly, the Syiem agreed to furnish materials for the construction of a road through his territories, receiving payment for the sum and after its completion to adopt such measures as might be necessary to help it in repair. This was the third occasion on which Europeans had entered the hill territory of the Khasi tribes.</p>

In March lower Assam was formally annexed. In the same year, the Kachari kingdom was annexed under the Doctrine of Lapse after the king Govinda Chandra was killed.
</p>
								<p>1829  The peace was suddenly broken by an attack made, on 4 April by the people of Nongkhlaw on the survey party engaged in laying out the road, resulting in the massacre of two British officers and between fifty and sixty natives. This led to a general confederacy of most or the neighbouring chiefs to resist the British.

								<p>In the heat of the war, a treaty was concluded between Dewan Singh, Syiem of Sohra and David Scott, on behalf of the East India Company on the 12 September 1829 by which Dewan Singh surrendered Saitsohpen in exchange of Pandua. It became a base of military operations for the British.

								<p>1829-30 Talk of transfer of certain lands in the plains of Sylhet (near Pandua/Mouzah Burryaile) to the Syiem of Sohra in exchange for the lands at Sohra ceded by him to the government for the purpose of a sanitorium. On 12 September, a treaty was concluded between Dewan Singh, the Syiem of Sohra and David Scott, on behalf of the East India Company, by which Dewan Singh surrendered Saitsohpen in exchange for Pandua. It became the base of military operations for the British.
</p>
								<p>1830  Potatoes were first introduced into the country by Mr. David Scott, the Governor General’s Agent.
</p>
								<p>Bor Manick of Shyllong was trapped, imprisoned though later released and forced to sign a treaty with the English. The English managed to bring a split among the “Bakhraws” of Shyllong State which finally bifurcated the Shyllong State into Khyrim and Mylliem.
</p>
								<p>15 January 1830:   Agreement between David Scott, Esq, Agent to the Governer-General, and Burro Manika, Raja of Khyrim.
</p>
								<p>In a letter from David Scott to Ram Singh (13 April 1830) the English considered it improper for Ram Singh to establish a chokey at Chapper Mookh to levy a toll on passing boats because the southern side of the river formed the boundary of Sutnga, the northern side of the river, the boundary of the British.
</p>

</p>
								<p>James Rae resigned later that year.</p>

								<p>A detachment of troops arrived at Cherrapunjee Station early in October 1830.
</p>
								<p>1831  Four British subjects residing in the Plains were seized by Chattar Sing, the Rajah of Goba, one of the petty chieftains of Jaintia. The four were carried to the temple at Goba and sacrificed to Kali.
</p>
								<p>Rambrai heavily assaulted the 3 Doars in the plains and this attack has been taken to be “the most serious that had taken place since the catastrophe at Nongkhlaw in 1829”. Rambrai was then invaded by British troops, a heavy fine was imposed and an agreement was forced to be signed.
</p>
         								<p>At the beginning of the 19th century robbery and murder were common on the northern frontier, but the Khasis were soon pacified after the annexation of the Assam Valley, and the last outbreak took place in 1831.
</p>
        								<p>David Scott, Agent to the Governor General of the North-Eastern Frontier of Bengal and Commissioner of Revenue and Circuit in the district of Assam, North-Eastern part of Rungpur, Sherpur and Sylhet, died on 20 August, aged 45 years and 3 months[9].

								<p>1832 18 year old Anglo-Indian Alexander Lish was sent by William Carey of the Serampore Mission to commence missionary operations in Cherrapunjee (soon after the Government recently established a Sanatorium).
</p>
								<p>Two British subjects were passing along the high road in Assam when they were suddenly seized, carried up into the hills in the neighbourhood of Goba, and after having been decked with new clothes and jewels, they were led to be sacrificed, together with two other persons, also subjects of this government. One of the individuals first named succeeded in making his escape and on his return to the plains he gave information of what had occurred, and, as his statement was corroborated by many collateral circumstances, there is no reason whatever to doubt the truth of what he said. The crime was perpetrated; it is to be feared as, regards the other three individuals, as they have never since heard of...
</p>
								<p>The information about the existence of large deposits of coal at Cherrapunjee came to light in the year of 1832.
</p>
								<p>21 November 1832:  Recognizance between the Agent to the Governor-General, and Wookushun Raja and Wooanluka Raja, residents of Mullai Poonjee, having appeared before Mr. H. Inglis on the banks of the river Jadukata.</p>

								<p>1833   Teerut Singh, having received assurance that his life would be spared, surrendered on 13 January and was imprisoned for life in Dacca. The meeting was held at Nursingaree, about one mile east of Umshillong (the place was most probably Rangkyndur, a spot very near to the Umshillong stream just below Shillong Peak). A long and harassing war came to a close. Cherrapunji then became the headquarters of the Sylhet Light Infantry, whose Commandant was placed in political charge of the district, including the former dominions in the hills of the Raja of Jaintia.</p>

								<p>9 February 1833: Kabuliat between The Hon’ble East India Company and Wookwing Longdoo, inhabitant of Nongklang, appertaining to Rambrai.</p>

								<p>Towards the end of 1833, Lish visited Calcutta and was ordained. A service was held on Boxing Day, the interest was enhanced by the fact that several Khasis, who had come down with Mr. Lish to see the wonders of the great city, were present on this occasion, when the first missionary was set apart to preach the Gospel to their tribe.</p>

								<p>The monopoly of the East India Company of the tea trade with China had ceased[10]. No advantage was taken of the discovery until after the monopoly of the East India Company of the tea trade with China had ceased in 1833.</p>

								<p>1834  Mr. Lish returned to the Hills in January, taking with him a native preacher, Jan, to work principally among the Bengali in the neighbourhood. Mr. Joshua Rowe accompanied him to establish an English Boarding School at Cherrapoonjee.</p>

								<p>Three schools were established by Mr. Lish – one at Cherrapoonjee, Mawsmai and Mawmluh. Mr. Lish commented that “the only religion understood by them consisted in endeavouring to appease the demons with sacrifices of goats, fowls, sheep and pigs.”</p>

If the Company approves of the road, a receipt for Rs. 4,000 will be granted.</p>

								<p>29 March 1834:    The Hon'ble Company, through Francis Jenkins, Esq., Agent to the Governor-General, had appointed, Runjun Singh, inhabitant of Nuckna, as Raja of the territories of the former Raja Tirut Singh.</p>

								<p>In 1834 Lord WilIiam Bentinck recorded a minute, stating that his attention had been called to the subject previous to his having left England, and he appointed a committee to prosecute inquiries, and to promote the cultivation tea.</p>

								<p>1835 21 January 1835:   Agreement between the Agent to the Governor-General and Oan Sirdar, resident of Sajur Poonjee, Okenglung, resident of Nung Kunja Poonjee.

								<p>On 11 February, The Governor General in Council appointed Captain Lister as the Political Agent. The station at Sohra being the only place at that time, over which the Agent exercised sole jurisdiction. However, he was in charge of relations with the Jaintia Raja.</p>

								<p>On 15 March, after two years of fruitless negotiations, Captain Lister, commanding the Sylhet Light Infantry Battalion, in the company of Mr. H. Inglis (his son-in-law), then having the local rank in the same corps, proceeded to Jaintiapur[11].  The Raja of Jaintia voluntarily relinquished his dominion on the confiscation of his territory in the plains. It was alleged that the Raja failed to stop human sacrifices. British gained control of the Jaintia Hills.</p>

								<p>At this time, Captain R. B. Pamberton wrote about the Khasis and Jaintias “they descended into the plains both of Assam and Sylhet, and ravaged with fire and sword the villages which stretched along the base of this lofty region. Night was the time almost invariably chosen for these murderous assaults, when neither sex nor age were spared”.</p>

								<p>1836 Tea is successfully manufactured in Upper Assam which leads to a tea industry.</p>

								<p>1837  Of the natives during his 1837 visit, botanist William Griffith had ‘little to say’:  “They are a stout-built, squat, big-legged hill tribe: the women in regard to shape being exactly like their mates; and as these are decidedly ugly—somewhat tartarish-looking people, very dirty, and chew pawn to profusion—they can scarcely be said to form a worthy portion of the gentler sex”.</p>
           
								<p>1838   Upper Assam was formally annexed into the British empire. This is attributed to the successful manufacture of tea.</p>

								<p>In 1838 the first twelve chests of tea from Assam were received in England.</p>

								<p>The work in the Khasi Hills, started by Alexander Lish, is abandoned. Alexander Lish stayed in Cherrapunjee for 6 years learning the language, opening a number of schools and retranslating the New Testament again using Bengali script.</p>

								<p>William Carey had significant links in Liverpool in Wales. The treasurer of Serampore group Samuel Hope and the Secretary of the Welsh Mission Rev. John ‘Minimus’ Roberts lived very close by at Liverpool, perhaps provoking the interest of the Welsh Mission in Khasi Hills.</p>

								<p>1839   With the annexation of the Maran/Matak territory in the east, the annexation of Assam was complete. In the same year the Assam Company was founded.</p>

								<p>With the fall of Nongkhlaw and with the annexation of the Jayantia Parganas in 1835, the British, thought that all encounters must have been quelled, but the scene of the struggle could still be seen. Sngap Singh of Maram continued  the struggle for four years more, till he was forced to surrender in 1839.</p>

								<p>Mercantile associations for the planting and manufacture of tea in Assam began to be formed in 1839.</p>

								<p>As prospects were limited and there were better facilities for raising large amounts of capital in London, Bengal Tea Association of Calcutta was persuaded to amalgamate with the Assam Company of London in 1839.</p>

								<p>1840  Thomas Jones and his wife arrive at Cherrapunjee heading the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Mission. This saw the beginning of a remarkable interaction with the Khasis. They set about the work of educating the Khasis and translating the scriptures.</p>

								<p>After staying a few weeks in Calcutta, on 22 June they arrive in Cherrapunjee. They traveled down the Hoogly river, the Sunderbans, up the river networks to Surma river and fresh water jheels (inland water bodies) to the foothills below Cherrapunjee. Then they had to climb up the mountains on foot or had to be carried in ‘Khoh Kit Briew’ – a Khasi special purpose basket fpr carrying people – up 4,500 feet.</p>

								1849  On 1 March, Reverend William Pryse and his wife arrive in the Hills.

								On the retirement of Colonel Lister (to Europe on sick certificate), the charge of the hills was re-transferred to the Commissioner of Assam and the Assistant Commissioner. The civil functions of the Political Agent of the Khasi Hills were seperated from the command of the Sylhet Light Infantry and vested on the Assistant Commissioner on the same footing as the Principal Assistant in the province of Assam.

								It was in 1854, an order from Fort William was given that the command over the Military and Civil administration should "no longer come under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent." "Military," therefore, assumed a new department away from the "Civil" Administration. Probably it might be because of this that the Cossyah Hills Political Agency ended and in its place, there was the "Cossyah and Jynteah Hills District".

								C.K. Hudson was appointed as the first Principal Assistant Commissioner of the Cossyah and Jynteah Hills District.

								J.B. Shadwell was appointed the second Principal Assistant Commissioner (when?).

								1857   Mr. Thomas Jones joins Mr. Pryse in Sylhet in March.

								Three companies of mutineers came within 20 miles of Sylhet. Their evident design was to attack first the Europeans in Sylhet Station, and afterwards proceed to the Hills, by way of Jaintiapore. Major Byng, who commanded the troops at Cherra (300 of the native soldiers stationed at Cherra were Hindus), hastened to meet the rebels, and inflicted a crushing defeat, at the cost of his own life.

								From this year, the relation between the Khasi States and the English was regulated through ‘Sanads’ and ‘Parwanas’, which were Appointment Letters under the seal and hand of the British Government confirming the election or selection or appointment of any Khasi ruler.

								Agreement entered into with the government by the late Rajah of Lungree, Soonder Sing, on the 22nd September 1859.

								Oo Sep Sing, Rajah of Maram, on the 22nd September 1859, ceded, in consideration of receiving half the profits all his mineral rights (except those connected with the Mahram tracts leased to the late Mr. Henry Inglis).

								1860  Reverend James Roberts and his wife arrived in Cherra in March.

								On 16 December Mr. And Mrs. Lewis left their much loved Hills, after 18 years, quietly during the night, never to return again.

								A light house tax was imposed in the Jaintia Hills. A member of the Cherra Church, was appointed collector of the new tax. Portions of the country immediately rose in rebellion but were supressed and disarmed. Towards the end of the year new taxation was introduced.

								Investigations were conducted by the Board of Revenue and the Military Department and in 1860, the authorities mooted the idea of shifting the district headquarters of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills to Shillong.
